# ChalkDuster

A collaborative white board application with multiple user support in real time along with a chat app. 
The application allows to connect geographically dispersed people by providing them a platform to collaborate and work on their ideas.

Built using
1. [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
2. [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/)
2. [PubNub](http://https://www.pubnub.com)
3. [Firebase](firebase.google.com)

## Instructions

1. Clone the code

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/akshitsoni/chalkDuster.github.io.git
```

2. Start a basic web server. We used the Chrome 200OK server.
3. Run the website on your browser and you are ready to go.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Login with google not working**: Check the firebase client ids. You may need to provide your own.

2. **Collaborative drawing is not working**: Check the pubnub api key. You may need to provide a new api key.
